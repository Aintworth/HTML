                            <h2>Why we love hiking</h2>
                            <p>The warm sunshine on your face, the sound of the wind rushing through the trees overhead, and the soft earthy feel of the trail under your boots. Not only are these experiences enjoyable to have, but they’re good for you, too. Hiking is proven to have many health benefits, ranging from physical exercise you get when out on the trail, to emotional or mental relief that comes from being in nature</p>

                            <h2>Preparation</h2>
                            <p>For longer multi-day treks, make sure you pack the essential clothing, water, food, and equipment to last you between 2-9 days. Keep in mind that space for your luggage is limited. Packing your luggage as light as possible, and using a soft bag rather than a suitcase, is greatly appreciated.</p>
                            <p>Depending on the tour, your luggage will either be staying in a hut, transported by vehicle, or carried by you. For tours that include river crossings, using a waterproof duffel bag is the best way to keep your personal items dry. When selecting the size of your main luggage, a 70-80 L bag should be plenty of space.</p>

                            <h2>Precaution</h2>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Hike with a “buddy” when at all possible.</strong> If you choose to hike alone, make sure someone knows where you are headed and when you should be expected back (and check in with them when you do return). </li>
                                <li><strong>Avoid venturing off the beaten path.</strong> Staying on marked trails is important, regardless of how familiar you think you are with an area. Shortcuts can also cause erosion and damage to the environment. </li>
                                <li><strong>Stay hydrated and bring drinking water.</strong> Orange County may have perfect weather most of the year, but on the trails you’ll find that staying hydrated in the hot sun is vital. Bring water with you and drink plenty ahead of time.</li>
                                <li><strong>Know where you are going ahead of time.</strong> Check out the trail you plan to hike ahead of time to know what you are getting into. Will you need to be prepared for steep slopes or is it more of a casual stroll?  </li>
                                <li><strong>Keep an eye out for poison oak.</strong>Make sure you know how to identify poison oak ahead of time to prevent touching it. If you do, wash the area right away with some mild soap and water (water if that is all that you have). Pat dry the area with a clean towel. </li>
